+ currently only support for "topheadlines". "trending" and "sources" need to be added.
+ no error handling as of yet.
+ no log report generation.
+ usage:
    + update categoriesConfig.js with new category information.
    + run POST on /generate to generate the playlists and write to /uploads/playlistsData. CategoriesDB and PlaylistsDB will be updated. Playlists' articles array will be empty.
    + run POST on /tracks to generate article audios and update PlaylistsDB and ArticlesDB.
    + run GET on /categories/:categoryID, /playlists/:playlistID and /articles/:articleID.

## Issues
The value "category" being propagated down the pipline is undefined because of articles[j].playlist = { id: playlists[i].id }; app.js line 604. Causing crash at "Generating Tracks for category" line 806.
To fix, add category:playlists[i].title. But the category name is misleading, should be playlistTitle. Need to be refactored.

not writing test for tracksdb. keep running into error at 
    var bucket = new mongodb.GridFSBucket(db, { bucketName: "tracks" }); , the db part because it's outside of the function. Don't know how to plug that in.
